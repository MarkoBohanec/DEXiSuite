Install
=======

Tools for making DEXiEval installation archives:

- DEXiEval_<version>.zip
- DEXiEval_<version>.tgz

Both installation archives contain command-line utility program DEXiEval together with all
required class libraries for target systems:

- Java
- Windows [.NET Framework]
- NetCore [.NET Core]

In order to make installation packages, run MakeZipInstall.bat. Requirements:
- Info zip http://infozip.sourceforge.net/ or equivalent command-line zip archive maker
- Assumes that the tar utility is located at C:\Windows\System32\

After the packages have been built on /Install, they are transferred to the /Installers folder.

Packed Exe for Windows
----------------------

Run PackExe.bat to pack all DEXiEvalNet Release-version .exe and .dll files into a single DEXiEvalNet\Bin\Packed\DEXiEvalNet.exe.

In principle, only this single file is sufficient for deploying DEXiEval on a target system.

PackExe.bat uses LibZ, Copyright (c) 2013-2014, Milosz Krajewski

Packed Jar and Exe for Java
---------------------------

Run PackJar.btm to pack all DEXiEvalJava Release-version jars to:
- a single jar file DEXiEvalJava\Bin\Packed\DEXiEvalJava.jar
- a single exe file DEXiEvalJava\Bin\Packed\DEXiEvalJava.exe

In principle, each of these single files is sufficient for deploying DEXiEval on a target system.
The Java runtime engine must still be installed on the target system, together with a
proper setting of the JAVA_HOME environment variable.

DEXiEvalJava.exe is produced as a Windows wrapper around DEXiEvalJava.jar, using (and requiring):

launch4j: Cross-platform Java executable wrapper [https://launch4j.sourceforge.net/]
