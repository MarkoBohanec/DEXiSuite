Install
=======

Tools for making DEXiWin installation packages:

- DEXiWin_<version>.zip: Portable .ZIP package, to be unpacked on the target computer to some suitable folder and used outright.
- DEXiWin_<version>.msi: MS Installer package, to be run on the target Microsoft Windows computer.

The installation packages contain:

DEXiWin.exe: The main application file, and
Echoes.dll, Elements.dll and ObjectList.dll: Dynamic libraries used by the app.

In order to make installation packages, run MakeZipInstall.bat and/or MakeMsiInstall.bat, respectively.

Requirements:
- MakeZipInstall.bat requires Info zip http://infozip.sourceforge.net/ or equivalent command-line zip archive maker
- MakeMsiInstall.bat requires WiX Toolset https://wixtoolset.org/

After the packages have been built on /Install, they are transferred to the /Installers folder.

Packed Exe
----------

Run PackExe.bat to pack all Release-version .exe and .dll files into a single Bin\Packed\DEXiWin.exe.
In principle, only this single file is sufficient for deploying DEXiWin on a target system.
